What have I completed in this time?
I have a playable character that controls fairly well.
I have platforms that construct a level.
I made power-ups to help the player complete the level

Not completed:
I still need to program different power so that they work, instead of merely existing aesthetically.
I also need to still program respawning after death

Unexpected tasks:
I may need to figure out more about colliders to create more accurate collision without using a mesh collider. Box colliders work but are not a perfect match, and mesh colliders tend to lag the system.

From here on out, I am going to make the power-ups work and create a more extended level. I will also try and make respawning with checkpoints work as well.
